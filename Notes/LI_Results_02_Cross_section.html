<p>On average, labour income forms a larger share of market income relative to capital income. Thus, growth rates for labour income and market income in Table 1 are relatively close. <a href="#fig-mean_growth_inc_cap_lab">Figure&nbsp;2</a> highlights this further by plotting the cumulative growth in market income, labour income and capital income from 1991-2019.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-distribution-of-market-income-growth">The distribution of market income growth</h2>
<p>We now dive deeper by examining how market income growth had been distributed across individuals. To do so, we examine income growth across percentiles of market income using growth incidence curves. The aim is to identify which percentiles of the market income distribution experienced higher growth and which percentiles experienced a decline or stagnation.</p>
